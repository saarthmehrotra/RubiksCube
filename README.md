This is code that was written by me and four other classmates for our Software Design final.

Our goal is to create a piece of software that has the ability to generate a virtual Rubik's Cube which we can manipulate through key commands and an on screen GUI. When initialized our code prompts the user with the option of playing with the Rubik's Cube, which allows the user to manipulate the cube, randomize it, and then allow our AI to solve it.  The other option is to import a Rubik's Cube, which allows the user to take 6 pictures of a physical cube, and then generates the cube which then can be manipulated. When taking these pictures the user is told what orientation to to show the cube to the webcam. Our stretch goal, which is the final option, is combining the previous two options and teaching the user how to solve their physical cube.

To be able to run this code, you need to have VisualPython and SimpleCV.
